# Brewery Locator
Brewery Locator is a project I created to explore the MERN stack and development using docker. 

## Running
To start the app, simply run `docker-compose up` in the root directory. It may take a few minutes for the database to be seeded with data. The app will be available at http://localhost:8080/

## Acknowledgements
